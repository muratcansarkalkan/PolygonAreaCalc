# PolygonAreaCalc
I am trying to make a polygon app calculator for freecodecamp's Python tutorial.

"In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes."

So far I managed to make most of the methods but what is missing?
Making sure rectangle methods are used by square class
and use Get amount inside
